# About Found in Shikoku

Found in Shikoku is an archive of travel and cultural information on the fourth largest island in Japan. The contents originated in a blog called The Cup and the Road in 2015 with information on the Shikoku Pilgrimage. This site focuses on providing information on Shikoku that is not commonly found on English-language media. 

The purpose of this project is to use information as a micro connection between the global community and the people of Shikoku.
